# Criminal NER Model
This chapter describes how to develop an entity name recognition system in the criminal domain.
In this process, a new training data set was invented, and an NER experiment using pretrained language models was conducted.

# 1. Entity Definition
In terms of crime analysis, new entities can be defined.
Therefore, crime-related information that can be extracted from Korean crime facts is suggested. The result is shown in the figure below.

# 2. Data Collection & Building Training Data

## Data Collection
Criminal facts texts were collected from criminal sentences. By using sentence-split python library, crime facts paragraphs separated into sentences.

---example--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  **The suspect slept at the victim's house at 46, Yeonchang-ro 163beon-fil, Icheon-si, Gyeonggi-do around the evening of May 03, 2014.**
  
  **Two pieces, a hand mirror worth $10.00, a necklace worth $180.00, and one earring worth $50.00 were stolen.**
  
  **As a result, the suspect stole a total market value of $330.00 from the victim.**
 

## Building Training Data
In this process, a NLP Tagging Tool was made using python-pyqt5 library.
More information about the tagging tool can be found at the link below.

First, the rule-base approach was used initially.
Second, it was corrected by criminal analysts 
The tagging result is as follows.

---result--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  **The suspect <Yoo-Jeong Moon : PS_NAME_ACCUSED> and the vitim <Lee-Hyun : PS_NAME_VICTIM> are <friends : CV_RELATION>.**
