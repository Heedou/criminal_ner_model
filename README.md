This chapter describes how to develop an entity name recognition system in the criminal domain.
In this process, a new training data set was invented, and an NER experiment using pretrained language models was conducted.

# 1. Entity Definition

# 2. Data Collection & Building Training Data
In this process, a NLP Tagging Tool was made using python-pyqt5 library.
First, the rule-base approach was used initially.
Second, it was corrected by criminal analysts
